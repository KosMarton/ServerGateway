# Server Gateway
## A simple and fast C# Framework that allows you to communicate with a server over SSH and SFTP connections.

This Framework will be continuously developed and expanded with additional features.
For now this is only a Beta version of the Framework, but the main functionalities are already implemented in the code.
Feel free to send issues to help the development of the Framework.

## How to use it?

To clone the repository just go to the desired directory on your machine, open a cmd and type: `git clone  https://github.com/KosMarton/ServerGateway`.
Then if the repository have cloned to your directory, open the Visual Studio Solution file that the repository comes with (ServerGateway.sln).
Then just build and run the program. Don't forget to fill in the server parameter variables in the demonstration file (Demonstration.cs).

If you want to use the Framework in your projects just import the `ServerGateway.cs` file into your project and include the `ServerGateway` namespace.

Have fun and good coding :)
