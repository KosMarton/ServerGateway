# ServerGateway
A simple and fast C# API that allows you to communicate with a server over SSH.

This API will be continuously developed and expanded with additional features.
For now this is only an Alpha version of the API, but the main functionalities are already implemented in the code.
Feel free to send issues to help the development of the API.
